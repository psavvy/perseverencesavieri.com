Statistical consultants often encounter researchers needing support with study design and data analysis, particularly when it comes to selecting the appropriate analysis method. Despite formal training in quantitative courses, many academic researchers lack hands-on experience, leading to uncertainty in their statistical decisions. My PhD research aims to bridge this gap by developing innovative AI tools, specifically R Shiny applications, that provide researchers with critical feedback on their statistical analyses. This project focuses on areas where non-statisticians commonly struggle, such as residual diagnostics for verifying regression assumptions, interpreting multi-way interactions, and selecting covariance structures in mixed models. These tools are designed not to be exhaustive but to offer essential scientific guidance and reflections on specific statistical techniques and assumptions, fostering more robust and confident analysis.

## Scientific Interests

My research interests span a broad spectrum of topics within the medical sciences, with a particular focus on:

-   Public Health, Epidemiology, and Biostatistics: Exploring statistical methods to enhance the understanding of population health trends and disease dynamics.
-   Health and Medical Informatics: Integrating data science with healthcare systems to improve decision-making and patient outcomes.
-   Precision Medicine and Pharmacometrics: Tailoring medical treatments to individual characteristics, including the development of models to optimize drug therapy.
-   High-Dimensional Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Applying advanced analytical techniques to manage and interpret complex, large-scale datasets in medical research.
-   Statistical Programming: Developing and utilising computational tools to perform rigorous statistical analyses, with a focus on reproducibility and efficiency.
