As a **Principal Statistical Consultant** at [SQUARE](https://square.research.vub.be/home), I provide comprehensive statistical support to researchers at all levels, from master’s students to PhD candidates and postdoctoral researchers. Since 2021, I have assisted over 100 researchers, guiding them through various stages of their research projects.

## Services I offer include:

-   **Consultations:** Tailored one-on-one sessions to address specific statistical questions, research design, and analysis challenges.
-   **Workshops:** I regularly conduct workshops through the doctoral school, including an Introduction to R, designed to build foundational programming and data analysis skills for researchers.
-   **Statistical Coaching:** Ongoing guidance to support hands-on data analysis, helping researchers gain confidence in their methods and approaches.
-   **Data Analysis, Visualisation, and Interpretation:** Assistance with analysing data, visualising results in meaningful ways, and interpreting findings to ensure clarity and accuracy in reporting.
-   **Scientific Writing and Communication of Results:** Support with the drafting and structuring of research papers, ensuring statistical findings are clearly communicated to meet publication standards.
-   **Mock Defenses and Prescreening:** I participate in mock defenses and prescreen internal projects for FWO submissions, including predoc, postdoc, and ZAP projects, helping researchers refine their proposals and presentations.
