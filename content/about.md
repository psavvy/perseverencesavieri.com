I am a doctoral researcher in medical sciences at the VUB within the Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Research Group [(BISI)](https://bisi.research.vub.be/). As part of my PhD thesis, I'm developing innovative AI tools (R Shiny applications) to provide researchers with critical feedback on statistical analyses, helping improve their findings' reliability and validity. This [research](/research/) is driven by my commitment to making complex statistical concepts more accessible and actionable for non-statisticians.

In addition to my research, I serve as a principal statistical consultant through the Support for Quantitative and Qualitative Research Core Facility [(SQUARE)](https://square.research.vub.be/home), offering broad-scale statistical and methodological quantitative support through consultations, statistical coaching, data analyses and workshops. See more under [consulting](/consulting/).

In my spare time, I like to take walks in nature. I also enjoy playing chess, doing activities with my family and traveling. Currently learning photography and painting.

Do not hesitate to [contact me](/contact/) if you have any questions or inquiries.
